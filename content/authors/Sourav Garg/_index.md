I am a robotic-vision enthusiast. My research spans computer vision, robotics and deep learning, motivated by practical applications that involve a moving camera. I am currently the lead research fellow of [QUT's Perception and Localisation](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/perception-localisation/) research program.
