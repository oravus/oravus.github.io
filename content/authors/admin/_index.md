I conduct research in Embodied Intelligence, which spans robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. I have a keen interest and experience in visual place recognition, localization, navigation, image retrieval, and scene understanding. 

I am currently leading robot navigation research at the [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/), University of Adelaide, with Prof. [Ian Reid](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ATkNLcQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr [Feras Dayoub](https://ferasdayoub.com/). Previously, I was the lead research fellow at [QUT's Perception & Localisation](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/perception-localisation/) research program, following on from my PhD at the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Centre_for_Robotic_Vision), advised by Prof. [Michael Milford](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/our-people/academic-profiles/michael.milford) and Prof. [Niko Suenderhauf](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/). Before PhD, I worked as a robotics researcher in industry at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) with Dr [Swagat Kumar](https://sites.google.com/site/swagatkumar/home), following my graduation from [Thapar University](https://www.thapar.edu/). I work closely with Prof. [Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), IIITH, India.
